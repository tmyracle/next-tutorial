        <p>
          Most recently I was a Senior Product Manager at Samsara where I worked
          on products in the manufacturing space. This was my first experience
          having to take into account the tradeoffs between hardware and
          software and what that means for the product development process.
        </p>
        <p>
          I moved to San Francisco for the role at Samsara because I wanted to
          get back into product and work with teams to build things that
          delighted customers. I also knew that the Bay Area was the epicenter
          for the tech industry and I needed to be there to expand my network
          and career.
        </p>
        <p>
          My first experience in technology was at RigUp where I joined as a
          very early employee. At that point we didn't yet have a cohesive
          product or any customers, we were still searching for a path forward.
          I was fortunate that I had domain knowledge in the energy industry and
          could make use of that to help shape potential products. I had also
          spent some of my downtime when I was working on rigs in the Gulf of
          Mexico or in South Texas learning Ruby on Rails and basic web
          development.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here's an old picture from 2013 where I was learning Rails while
          working in South Texas outside of Cotulla:
          <img src="/images/rails.JPG" />
        </p>
        <p>
          My interest in building software combined with my domain expertise in
          the energy industry allowed me to carve out a product management role
          for myself. One thing led to another and I ended up leading product at
          RigUp up until just after our Series C round. After 4 years of leading
          product I transitioned into a new role exploring new verticals. This
          role ended up being a hybrid of research, analysis, and corporate
          development. I ended up learning a lot in that role and one of those
          learnings was that I was much happier and more fulfilled when I was
          working on product.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a previous life I was an engineer in the energy industry after
          getting a degree in Chemical Engineering at Texas A&M University. I
          grew up in Texas and that meant that oil & gas was THE industry to go
          into. I didn't have much exposure to white collar career paths growing
          up aside from basic things like nursing or accounting. I sometimes
          regret that I didn't major in computer science, but the truth is I had
          no idea that computer science was even a field that I could enter. I
          didn't know anyone growing up that worked on software or technology
          and our high school didn't seem to do much in the way of infoming us
          about potential fields to enter and degrees to pursue.
        </p>
        <p>
          The only thing I knew about my academic future was that I wanted to be
          an engineer because I was good at math and science and I knew that
          engineers were paid well. When I came to the realization that you need
          to choose a particular branch of engineering to go into I chose
          Chemical Engineering because I enjoyed Chemistry so it seemed like a
          decent enough of a fit. As far as A&M is concerned, it was the only
          school that I applied to. I had a group of friends in my AP physics
          class that were all applying to Texas A&M engineering programs so I
          pretty much just tagged along. Luckily I was accepted into the
          Chemical Engineering program and that was that.
