The biggest hill to climb for any customer is simply getting started. If you’re not able to get the customer to that **“wow”** moment before they lose interest then it doesn’t matter how many features and bells and whistles your product has.

Building amazing software is a challenge and hardware products are even more difficult... especially early stage products. Your product team has sprinted to get the first version of the product ready so inevitably you’ve cut a few corners. The set up process might be non-linear and disjointed, the support documentation is sparse, and your early customers are constantly emailing you asking you how to accomplish the most basic tasks.

Once the core set of initial features is done and you’re ready to go to market take 2-3 weeks and focus the team on set up polish. Go through the onboarding process until you can do it in your sleep. Time how long it takes to get to the initial point of getting value out of the product. Simplify, simplify, simplify. Eliminate the dead ends users might get themselves in, clarify copy, and pressure test navigation.

Early stage products have enough risk already, make sure there’s nothing getting in the way of your customers simply getting started.
