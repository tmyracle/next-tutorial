**Background and Rationale**
Since getting into startups and tech back in 2014 my health has slowly deteriorated. 5 years at a high growth startup did no favors for my waistline when my main coping mechanisms for stress are eating and drinking.

Long story short I’m currently 31 years old and 275lbs at 6'1”. When I moved to Austin to join RigUp I was around 220lbs so I’ve put on 55lbs or so over the past 6 years.

Another catalyst for wanting to improve my health was my dad having a heart attack last December and undergoing a quadruple bypass surgery at the age of 52. It was a wake up call for me given that cardiovascular issues are hereditary and having that procedure at a relatively young age didn’t exactly scream out positive things for me genetically. I began working out again and eating better after moving to San Francisco in January, but between starting a new job at Samsara, a global pandemic, and getting laid off in May all of my fitness ambitions fell to the wayside.

I’m in a much more stable position now having just secured a great job so its time to focus on health as my next obsession rather than work. I’m a tech guy at heart so I’ll take advantage of any tools I can get my hands on to help me in my journey. I realize that I'm incredibly priviledged to be able to invest in these tools and that they're absolutely not necessary to lose weight and improve cardiac health.

The rest of this post is devoted to describing the tools and rationale behind them.

**Eight Sleep Pod**
We bought the Eight Sleep Pod when we moved from Austin to San Francisco. We needed a new bed since our old King bed wouldn’t fit in our smaller bedroom so I took the opportunity to try out a “smart” bed. The biggest game changer is the ability to control the temperature of the bed throughout the night. I sleep hot so having the ability to cool the bed on my side without bothering my partner helps ensure I get a better night sleep. The analytics around sleep quality and duration are nice, but the biggest winner here is temperature control. Sleep is incredibly important for overall health so this one is a no-brainer.

**Peloton Bike**
COVID-19 shut down all of the gyms in SF so my exercise options were pretty much limited to body weight and running/walking. I’m heavy enough right now where running is very hard on my knees and shins and walking is boring as shit. My preferred methods of exercise are weight lifting and HIIT (when I was in better shape). The Peloton Bike serves a couple of key purposes.

- Low impact exercise - I can ride without having to be too hard on my joints and get a great workout in.
- Motivation - The instructors, challenges, streaks, etc all contribute towards helping me stay motivated. I don’t love exercise so every little bit of motivation helps.
- Convenience - I’ve learned when it comes to working out that if it’s not convenient then I’ll find any excuse to avoid it.

I’ve only had it for a little bit less than a week, but I’m loving it so far. Nothing better than having a great HIIT workout on-demand available from your living room. I’m even thinking about taking up cycling once I get in better shape.

**Apple Watch**
I just upgraded to the new Apple Watch Series 6 from my original Apple Watch that I’ve had for 6-7 years now. I primarily use the Apple Watch for reminders, notifications, heart rate monitoring, and ECG.

One thing that I am tracking as a key metric for improving cardiovascular health is my 2 minute heart rate recovery (HRR). Low 2 minute HRR is correlated with early death in adults and that’s something that I’d like to avoid so I’m going to be tracking my 2 minute HRR on at least a weekly basis to track its progress. Luckily the Apple Watch with calculate this for you automatically as long as you log a workout using the watch.

**Withings Body+ Scale**
This is a wifi-connected scale that is used to track weight, body fat %, muscle %, bone %, water %, and BMI. I plan on using this daily to track my progress. I chose this scale because you can connect it to Apple Health and then sync your weight and other body measurements to all other relevant apps like MyFitnessPal, Peloton, etc.

**MyFitnessPal**
I use this to log my calories and make sure that I’m hitting some key macronutrient goals. My main focus right now is just ensuring I’m getting enough protein (at least 100g and ideally closer to +150g) and that I’m staying under my calorie goal for the day which is currently ~1,800 (I have a lot of excess body fat to shed).

My calories burned from exercise automatically comes in via Apple Health integration, but I typically disregard those and try to stick to my gross calorie goal rather than my net goal after workout calories burned added back.

**Zero**
This is a very basic timer app used to track fasting periods. I find that my body responds really well to 16-18hr daily fasts as it helps smooth out my blood glucose and helps me avoid feeling sluggish and having crashes. I typically fast from around 8pm - 3pm, then break my fast with a whey protein shake and make a late lunch. Then i’ll have a light dinner with my girlfriend around 7pm before starting my next fast.

**Apple Health**
The nexus of my health stack is Apple Health which acts as a central dispatch to read data in from various sources (Peloton, Eight Sleep Pod, Withings Body+ Scale) and then write to other applications to put together a holistic view of my health.

**KPIs**
Here are some of the metrics that I am tracking in order of importance

1. Weight (lagging indicator)
2. Body Fat % (lagging indicator)
3. 2 Minute HRR (lagging indicator)
4. Active Workout Minutes Per Day (leading indicator)
5. Active Workout Calories Per Day (leading indicator)
6. Calories Consumed (leading indicator)

**Summary**
I’ll probably make changes over time, but this is what I’m using as my primary fitness stack for now. My midterm goals are to hit the following by the end of the year (Dec 31st, 2020):

- Body weight: 250lbs (25lb reduction)
- Body fat %: <42% (5% reduction, will need to check this based on accuracy)
- 2 Minute HRR: >35 (improve from 27)
